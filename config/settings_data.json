That moment left her wondering why humanity didn’t put more thought into the ingredients we put on our skin and down our drains. It’s a moment that stuck with her and inspired her to dig deeper and look for a way to do better.<br\/><br\/>She set out to make an eco-friendly soap that was truly made from nature. The result was a  biodegradable bar soap with loads of lather that leaves your skin feeling healthy.<br\/><br\/>Now, our handmade soap can be found in National Parks and zero waste stores across the country. We’ve become a personal care brand that makes products that are good for your skin, and the planet. From lip balms to bath salt, we pride ourselves on putting the same love and care into each of our products as we did those first bars of soap.<\/p>"

I was adamant about not using fragrance oils or artificial colors, both of which are still common ingredients in the “natural” soap industry today. Over the last decade, making soap for my community has become my love language. We’re creating a product at Mountain Time Soap that has the ability to make a positive impact on someone’s life every single day, which is an opportunity we don’t take lightly. We strategically use aromatherapy to boost your mood, bring you comfort, and leave you with a feeling of well-being. From washing your hands in the backcountry, to teaching your children the importance of hand washing at the kitchen sink, I hope you feel the joy and love I put into making your soap. <\/p><p>Adventure on, wash your spirit clean.<\/p>",

We recommend using within one year. Store in a cool dry place. Once you’ve put it to use in the shower, keep your soap high and dry! Allowing your soap to dry out properly in between uses will vastly prolong it’s life. Keep it out of steady water streams and use a dish that allows proper drainage like our Soap Decks."
